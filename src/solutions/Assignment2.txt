2A
Please provide a Java program that uses the interface of a control class for managing salesmen and their
performance records. In the backend, integrate a local MongoDB database that contains of two collections
for storing general data for salesmen as well as their social performance records. Please make suitable 
assumptions on the schema of the two collections. Please do not use frameworks like Spring Boot, use the 
pure MongoDB driver.

    The solution to this assignment is src/main/java/de/hbrs/ia/code/ManagePersonal.java

2B Does the interface of the control class fulfill the CRUD pattern entirely? If not, please add the missing operations 
and refactor the given interface accordingly. No implementation of the “U” is required (exception: adding further social 
performance records to a salesman).

    It does not fully fulfill the CRUD pattern, as the delete action is missing. 
    I also added a separate read action to filter for a specific year.

2C Test your application sufficiently by developing a Junit-Test Case. If possible, provide roundtrip test to ensure, 
that now data waste is given after the execution of a test.

    The solution to this assignment is src\test\java\test\ManagePersonalImplTest.java
